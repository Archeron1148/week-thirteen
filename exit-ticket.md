In this document I will examine how the course of my own thought about digital archaeology has transformed over this term with reference to previous repositories. I will then analyse how our work with the graveyard project fits into some of the antagonisms of digital archaeology by visiting my greatest success and most glorious failure. Finally, I will give my last words (for this course at least) on digital archaeology, what it is, what it ought to be, and what my greatest takeaways from this course are.

Repositories

Great success

Fail: collecting data week 2. Fetishization of data, technology – it always appears much simpler on the surface, its just putting in numbers how long could that take. Collaboration, learning from others’ failures on discord – perhaps I should have done more of this.

Final remarks

1. Situate the emergence and evolution of digital archaeology within the historiography of archaeology more broadly (analytical ability, argumentation)
2. Implement and contribute to a digital archaeology gravestones’ and monuments survey (methodology, collaboration, professionalization)
3. Investigate data, artifacts, and primary sources, using the methods/techniques/perspectives of digital archaeology and digital humanities (analytical ability, methodology, collaboration, professionalization)
4. Develop online experiences that communicate the results of these investigations as an act of public digital archaeology (collaboration, professionalization, argumentation)
5. Given that this is an online course, another outcome will be your ability to conduct such research independently. However, no one operates in a vacuum; digital archaeologists collaborate to troubleshoot or develop technologies, and through open practices to data sharing and reuse, learn to build upon each others’ work in a collaborative fashion. (collaboration, professionalization, methodology)
